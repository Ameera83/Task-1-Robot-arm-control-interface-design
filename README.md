task1:Robot arem GUI:
The first task is to design an interface to control the robot arm.
I used code (CSS, JAVA, HTML) for the interface. The code was written using the Visual Studio Code program.
Then we created a database called (db_1) through PHP MyAdmin and create table named (motor1) then I added the motors and their values in addition to two buttons to run and save.
I also linked the database to the interface via the PHP code.


Task2:
It is the design of the control interface with directional buttons to control the directions of the robot
To design it, an HTML page was created and we added a CSS link to it to give the buttons a look.
We also linked the interface to a database that we called (direction).
And we created in the database a table and entered the names of the buttons and called it the directional buttons, and finally we added screenshots of both the interface and the database table.
