task1:Robot arem GUI:
The first task is to design an interface to control the robot arm.
I used code (CSS, JAVA, HTML) for the interface. The code was written using the Visual Studio Code program.
Then we created a database called (db_1) through PHP MyAdmin and create table named (motor1) then I added the motors and their values in addition to two buttons to run and save.
I also linked the database to the interface via the PHP code.
